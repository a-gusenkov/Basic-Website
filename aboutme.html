      <p class="first-par">
        I am currently a junior at Macaulay Honors College at Brooklyn College majoring in Computer Science and more recently Multimedia Computing. While college was the first place where I was exposed to coding and computer science I soon found a deep love for the puzzle-like problem-solving skills involved in code creation and debugging. Experimenting with simple HTML and CSS code in my freshman year of college is what pushed me to commit to Computer Science as my major. Since then I've also started to explore how the user experiences and interacts with software by learning about digital and internet art through my Multimedia Computing major. Currently, a couple of my friends and I are in the pre-production stage of creating a fantasy adventure game utilizing the Unity game engine for macOS, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

        Outside of school many of my hobbies revolve around the skills I gained while being an art major in high school. When I have some free time I pick up a pencil and draw a portrait of my favorite game or movie character in my sketchbook. I am also currently working on a still life painting using acrylic paints, which is pretty new to me since I usually use water-soluble oil paints. Before the pandemic, I also really enjoyed going to escape rooms with my friends and hope to go once again once it's safe.
